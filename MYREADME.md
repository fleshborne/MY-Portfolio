# Responsive Portfolio Project
Blake Thompson


# Description 
User will be able to easily navigate through pages
`index.html`
`contact.html`
`portfolio.html`
These pages were built with CSS Bootstrap, which I used to build a responsive layout.
# Test
Users will have working links to use, going from page to page through the nav bar
Being able to check through my social media pages,
Even recent work that i've completed.

# Colaboration 
Wouldnt have been possible without stackoverflow
